				<p>Now what you hear is not a test: I'm rappin' to the beat. And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet. See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello. To the black, to the white, the red. And the brown, the purple and yellow. But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie. Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie. Let's rock, you don't stop. Rock the riddle that will make your body rock. Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along. And next on the mike is my man Hank, come on Hank, sing that song.</p>
